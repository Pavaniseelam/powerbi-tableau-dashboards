# Power BI & Tableau Dashboard Development

This repository showcases interactive dashboards built with **Power BI** and **Tableau**, designed to visualize **KPIs** and **business trends** for retail sales data. The goal of this project is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by presenting clear and actionable insights.

### 2. **Tableau: Sales Trends Dashboard**
   - Shows trends in sales, profit, and customer segments over time.
   - Interactive features for users to filter data by different regions and categories.
